== Component Options

The {doctitle} component supports 17 options, which are listed below.

[{tablespec}]
|===
| Name | Description | Default | Type
| ctgDebug                | Enable debug mode on the underlying IBM CGT client.     | false        | java.lang.Boolean
| eciBinding              | The Binding instance to transform a Camel Exchange to EciRequest and vice versa  |              | com.redhat.camel.component.cics.CICSEciBinding
| eciTimeout              | The ECI timeout value associated with this ECIRequest object. An ECI timeout value of zero indicates that this ECIRequest will not be timed out by CICS Transaction Gateway. An ECI timeout value greater than zero indicates that the ECIRequest may be timed out by CICS Transaction Gateway. ECI timeout can expire before a response is received from CICS. This means that the client does not receive the confirmation from CICS that a unit of work has been backed out or committed.   | 0            | short
